# JS-Sums

Eloquent JavaScript 3rd edition is a book about JavaScript, programming, and the wonders of the digital. You can read it online here https://eloquentjavascript.net/
Written by Marijn Haverbeke.

It includes Excercises for every topic and since I was reading and solving it, I decided to make a repository for solutions which are all solved by me. I am beginner to this as well so there are even better optimized solutions out there than I did here. Still one may use to refer it.

It is really great book to understand and learn Javascript. Must read if one is a beginner to JS or looking forward to learn JS. 

Thank you!
